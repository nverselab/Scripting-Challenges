# Welcome to PowerShell Challenges!

This section will include scenarios to test and expand your PowerShell skills.  Each Challenge will include (at least) three sections to complete with increasing difficulty.  Feel free to complete as many of these sections as you like.

## Core Tasks

This will be the primary task for each Challenge and is intended for beginner or novice scripters and will serve as the pre-requisit to the more difficult Tasks.

## Advanced Tasks

As the name suggests, these tasks will take the Core Task to the next logical step.  Advanced Tasks are intended for moderately experienced scripters to expand on what they may have already known or to give a bonus Challenge to those who solved the Core Task.

## Expert Tasks

Building on the progression of the Core and Advanced Tasks, Expert Tasks will offer much more complex items to accomplish using the same information.  These are intended for seasoned scripters who want to go the extra mile.
